Gonumerator is essentially a wrapper for other enumaration tools (Nmap and NSE Scripts, nfs mount, rpcclient, nbtscan, nc, masscan, onesixtyone, snmpwalk). It is an assistive tool for service identification and tracking enumeration data (DNS, SMB, NETBIOS, SMTP, SNMP, NFS and RPC) and giving indicators and decision support during penetration testing engagements.

The roadmap for this tool is to also be mapped to Mitre's Technical PRE-ATT&CK TTP's
